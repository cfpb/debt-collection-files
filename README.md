This repository contains native design files for a print version of the model
validation notice and source code for a responsive version of the model
validation notice designed by the Bureau in connection with its
[proposed debt collection rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/rules-under-development/debt-collection-practices-regulation-f/).


## About the proposed debt collection rule

The Bureau proposes to amend Regulation F, 12 CFR part 1006, which implements
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), to prescribe Federal rules
governing the activities of debt collectors, as that term is defined in the
FDCPA. The Bureau’s proposal would, among other things, address communications
in connection with debt collection; interpret and apply prohibitions on
harassment or abuse, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices
in debt collection; and clarify requirements for certain consumer-facing debt
collection disclosures.

Proposed Model Form B-3 in appendix B is a model validation notice form that
debt collectors could use to comply with the disclosure requirements of
proposed § 1006.34(a)(1) and (d)(1).

Proposed § 1006.42 would clarify how debt collectors may provide the validation
notice and other required disclosures electronically. Proposed § 1006.42(b)(4)
would require a debt collector who provides the validation notice described in
proposed § 1006.34(a)(1)(i)(B) electronically to provide the notice in a
responsive format that is reasonably expected to be accessible on a screen of
any commercially available size and via commercially available screen readers.
