## About the debt collection rule

On December 18, 2020, the Bureau issued amendments to Regulation F,
12 CFR part 1006 (December 2020 Rule),
which implements the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).
Regulation F prescribes Federal rules governing the activities of
debt collectors, as that term is defined in the FDCPA.
The December 2020 Rule, among other things, clarifies the information that
debt collectors must provide to a consumer
at the outset of debt collection communications and
provides a model validation notice containing such information.
Model Form B-1 in appendix B is the model validation notice that
debt collectors may use to comply with the
information and form requirements of § 1006.34(c) and (d)(1).  

The December 2020 Rule, including use of Model Form B-1,
is effective November 31, 2021.
